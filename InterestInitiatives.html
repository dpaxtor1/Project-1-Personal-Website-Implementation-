    <p>The past year I took part in a Decal course, where I learned the fundamentals of Adobe Illustrator and Photo shop. We worked on projects to practice design  and tools within the software. Our main projects focused on reflecting our creativity using what we have already learned. This offered the opportunity to experiment with design and grow my skills in Adobe software particularly illustration and photo editing at a comfortable pace.</p>

    <p>Iâ€™ve been curating content on TikTok and YouTube for a year, focusing on soft, aesthetically pleasing visuals that are simple yet attention-grabbing. I plan to monetize my channels in the future increasing my follower count and applying to their affiliate programs. In a span of a year, my content has reached over 111k combined views and 1,500+ likes and counting. This journey has allowed me to explore my creativity, refine my personal style, and build a community with people that my content that resonates with.</p>
